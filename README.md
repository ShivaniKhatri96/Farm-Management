## Links

- Logo from [Adobe logo-maker](https://express.adobe.com/express-apps/logo-maker/)
- Pictures from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
- `keycloak integration with react` tutorial followed from [dasniko](https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-reactjs-demo/)
- learned to add `animation to modals` from [animating modal views](https://web.dev/animating-modal-views/)
- `internationalization` added to the project by using tutorial from [go international with your next app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baLjPx_wFi4&list=LL&index=2&t=1265s&ab_channel=YouSuckAtCoding)

## Notes
- The point of adding i18n was to learn internationalization (i18n). Language translations was done manually and google translate was used to save time. So, the translations might not be 100% accurate. 
 
## More About this Project

This project has both frontend and backend. However, my main focus is frontend. This is the reason why backend code won't be added in the github. All the frontend code you will see in the github will be written by me. I will add the link to the website once the project is deployed.

## Thank you

_I would like to thank my brother who is an experienced backend developer for setting up backend for this project. Your help has been greatly appreciated!_

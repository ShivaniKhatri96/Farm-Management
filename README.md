## More About this Project
This project has both frontend and backend. However, my main focus is frontend. This is the reason why backend code won't be added in the github. All the frontend code you will see in the github will be written by me. I will add the link to the website once the project is deployed.

## Thank you
*I would like to thank my brother who is an experienced backend developer for setting up backend for this project. Your help has been greatly appreciated!*
